      It was determined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (presumably an objective, 
      unbiased group with no interest in distorting nutritional reality for the sake 
      of selling nutritional supplements) that a well-balanced diet could be optained 
      by an individual consuming the recommended daily portions from the Four Basic Food 
      Groups:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cereals and grains
        </li>
        <li>
          Fruits and vegetables
        </li>
        <li>
          Meat, fish and poultry
        </li>
        <li>
          Milk and dairy products
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="bold-text">
      Nutritional supplements were devised decades ago by medical researchers to be used, 
      as the concept denotes, as "supplementation" to correct existing deficiencies for 
      medical reasons. They were never intentended as core elements in the diet for health 
      people consuming well balanced diets.</p>
      <p class="bold-text">
      When it comes to calories, only a few hundred (200 to 400) calories in a surplus
      or in a deficit (depending on if you want to increase lean muscle mass or lose fat)
      would be sufficient. Don't do any extreme diets or extreme calorie intakes.
    </p>
    <p class="bold-text">
      The only supplementation that I would personally recommend is creatine and protein. It is not needed
      but it can definitely help with recovery and improve performance because taking a 5 grams of creatine is
      certainly easier than eating 3lb of chicken (3lb of chicken contains about 5 grams of creatine). It should always be used as an addition to the food,
      not replacement.
